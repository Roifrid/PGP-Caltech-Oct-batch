Agenda:
========================

- deletion of files in git local repo and Working directory

 step1: become root user in the lab

# sudo su -

step 2: go inside your working directory:

# cd myproject

step 3: git status ==> working tree clean

step 4: execute command ==> git ls-files    ==> list the files that are in local repo

step 5: select any filename and we are going to delete it form LR and WD

# git rm filename

because you did a deletion action-> a change occured on LR -> so we have to again commit the deletion of the file

# git commit -m "deletion of file"  --> commit all the changes/files that are in staging area


- Revert command

the revert command in git works only on a commit id

This command will be applied to only a single commit id

this command will revert the changes back to its previous version

deleted a file --> revert command on the deletion commit id --> we will get the file back to LR and WD

because you did a revert action-> a change occured on LR -> so we have to again commit

revert command will itself auto commit-> you dont have to exeucte the commit command

but what about the commit message?

so for this

revert command when executed--> will open an nano editor-> for you to enter a message -> save the file and come out of it
auto commit will complete by itself


- Branches, merging in git

> A branch represents an independent line on development
> keeps snapshot of your changes with your commit id
> without a branch it is not psosible to work on git
> We can commit only if we have a branch
> to keep a reference tyo your commit id-- git brings the concept of branching

 > knowingly or unknowingly -> you have been working on branches form the evry begining

 > whenever we do the command git init --> it creates a branch called as MASTER branch
 
 > it is the golden and default branch -> we cannot delete the branch -> we can rename it

> we can create more branches in the LR for new development/features/bugfixes

and then switch to the branch to do the changes and commits




we can merge the new branch with the main/master branch

steps 1: first switch to the branch where you have to do merging

stpe 2: then perform merge command

 # git merge featurebranchname master


merge command will merge all the commits and files from the feature branch to the master branch

thos commits and chnages/files that are not on master branch
